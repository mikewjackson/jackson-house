      "Membership at Jackson House isn't just about perks - it's about belonging to a community that celebrates craft, connection, and discovery. From the moment you walk through our doors, you're part of something bigger: a shared journey of taste, tradition, and togetherness.",
      "We'd love to share our journey. Whether you are a seasoned whiskey sipper or exploring craft cocktails for the first time, we want to join your exploration!",
      "Membership is important because it transforms visits into experiences. It ensures you're not just attending events - you're part of them. It gives you priority access, special discounts, and insider previews, but more than that, it gives you a seat at the table where stories are shared, friendships are made, and traditions are born."
